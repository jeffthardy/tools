# Game Jams
I don't want to document all the details on this page, but link to things I learned on various jams.

## Ludum Dare 44 - Top Hat Terror
The theme of this jam was "life is currency".  It was my first jam and also my first *finished* game.  This was a 48hr jam.

### Lessons Learned
* Update vs FixedUpdate \(TBD\)
* Audio can really win people over

## Rocky Mountain Game Developers Association - Game Jam 1
This jam had the theme of hope and had a team of 4 + 1 mentor.  We took that loosely and made a horror game where you are trying to resolve personal trama.  We took 2nd place out of 8 or so teams.  This was a 1 month jam.

### Lessons Learned
* Separating Code from Art can be important when working with artist (TBD)
* Creating minimum viable product early helped a lot
* Playtesting with uncontaminated people is important to know what confuses people

## Rocky Mountain Game Developers Association - Game Jam 2
The theme of this jam was 1v1 competitive games and creating as many ideas as possible.  I didn't know I'd be doing this until the day before and had limited time to devote, but still got 3 games done.  This was a 72hr jam.
